# AI LearnMate – AI Prototype Chatbot

AI LearnMate is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users in learning and answering questions in real time.
## 📌 Problem Statement

Many learners struggle to study effectively due to limited access to personalized academic support, delayed feedback, and a lack of guidance tailored to their individual learning pace and needs. Traditional learning platforms often provide generic content without adapting to a learner’s strengths, weaknesses, or preferred learning style. This results in poor engagement, low motivation, and inefficient learning outcomes—especially for students studying independently or in resource-constrained environments.

There is a clear need for an intelligent, accessible, and adaptive learning assistant that can:

* Provide personalized explanations and study support
* Answer questions in real time
* Recommend learning resources based on learner progress
* Encourage consistent and effective learning habits

AI LearnMate aims to address these challenges by leveraging artificial intelligence to support learners with a smart, interactive, and user-friendly learning companion.
